# Pages
## Project Description
Pages is a platform for musical talent to collaborate and share music. Its meant for people of any
skill level to create, share, and collaborate on music. Users can upload individual playing and
combine them with other parts, almost like an online band of sorts. Great for collaborating or
being seen by producers.

## The MVP
> The platform should have a website where people can share and collabrate their musical genius. Users can upload audio files of musical parts and combine them with other peoples to create beautiful songs. Smaller features are left up to you, but the general sharing and combining of music should be the first thing completed. 

## Milestones
Milestones include:
- Ability to upload and store audio files
- Combine different file together into one single audio file.
- Users have individual profiles for sharing nad uploading their music and songs they create

## Stretch Goals
Some stretch goals, but feel free to make your own: 
- Allow for tweaking of audio files using more specific features of the Web Audio API
- Main homepage of website where top songs and parts are featured
- Reviews from other users
- Request a part from an individual user.

## Tech Stack

* [React] - component based frame work, prevents boilerplating!
* [Firebase] - Integrates easily with both Flutter and React.
* [VisualStudioCode] - Good IDE for web development
* [git] - Pretty terminal. (Here is a [cheat sheet])
